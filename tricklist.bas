Attribute VB_Name = "tricklist"
'The following tricks are rewarded with points:
'Attempt them in this order:

'- Land on the pad (very easy)
'- land on the same pad more then once (very easy)
'- do summersalts in the air, then land(easy)
'- play chicken with the ground ie stay upsidedown for as long as possible, then land (easy)
'- fly under the pad as it's falling down on top of you, and survive it (intermediate)
'- do a 'supertrick', ie do a summersalt and land on the pad without thrusting (intermediate)
'- do a flyby over the pad, just above it, and as fast as possible (intermediate)
'- do an 'inverse landing' ie land on underside of the pad, with nose facing down, then survive it (moderate)
'- do an 'inverse landing', and then stay under the pad for as long as possible, and survive it (moderate)
'- do a 'megatrick', ie do a supertrick, and then fly under the falling pad, without dieing (hard)
'- do an 'inverse landing', and then a normal landing on the falling pad (very hard)
'- play 'padmington', ie do multiple 'inverse landings' with the same pad (damn hard)
'- do an 'inverse landing', and then land on pad with a super trick as it falls(extreamly hard)

'remember: you only get points for them if you actually land it, and the pad then falls off
'the screen. so, if your playing padmington, and you hit the thing a massive 30 times,
'giving you a bonus of like 300,000,000,000 points, and you then stack it, you get 0.

'also, your bonus points die away after a while.

'also, tricks are worth more at higher levels, and when you have more lives left.

'good luck!!!!! My high score is 1.8 billion
