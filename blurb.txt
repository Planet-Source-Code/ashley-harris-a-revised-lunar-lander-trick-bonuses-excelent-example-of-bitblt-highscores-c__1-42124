You all rememeber that old lunar lander game, right? land the spaceship on the pad without crashing? well, here is my version of it. excellent example of bitblting, double buffering, high scores, particles for an explosion, etc. It has a twist on the old game, no terrain, just a moving floating pad, it also has wind, and, belive it or not, trick bonuses. I submitted it as a school project a couple of days ago. It's very addictive, the entire class preatty much played it non-stop for three weeks. Enjoy! (vote if you like it)
